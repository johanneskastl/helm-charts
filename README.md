# helm-charts

Collection of helm charts I used in my personal clusters.

- [blocky](./charts/blocky/README.md)
- [jellyfin](./charts/jellyfin/README.md)
- [uptime-kuma](./charts/uptime-kuma/README.md)
- [vaultwarden](./charts/vaultwarden/README.md)
- [wallabag](./charts/wallabag/README.md)

This repository also contains a library chart called common, that is used by the actual helm charts.

Most of the charts in this repository were forked from the [k8s-at-home charts](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts) repository, which is no longer maintained.

Big shoutout and a big THANK YOU to the k8s-at-home folks for creating those charts in the first place.
