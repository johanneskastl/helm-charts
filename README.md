This repository also contains a library chart called common, that is used by the actual helm charts.

Most of the charts in this repository were forked from the [k8s-at-home charts](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts) repository, which is no longer maintained.

Big shoutout and a big THANK YOU to the k8s-at-home folks for creating those charts in the first place.
